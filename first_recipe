Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Peel 35g of ginger and put it in the bowl of a food processor. Roughly chop 4 cloves of garlic and 2 stalks of lemongrass and add them to the ginger. Add 1 tsp of ground turmeric, 2 birdâ€™s eye chilies and 6 tbsp of groundnut oil, then process the mixture to a thick paste.

Put the paste into a mixing bowl, add 400g of chicken wings and toss everything around so that the chicken is coated in the spice paste.

Tip it on to a roasting tray and bake it for 25 minutes. (Turn the wings over halfway through.)

Cut 2 plump pak choi into short lengths. Finely chop 3 spring onions. Remove the roasting tin from the oven, add the pak choi, spring onions and 200ml of coconut cream and toss them all together, then return the tin to the oven.
